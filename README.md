# Amigo-Device
The complexity and fragmentation of health records management present serious difficulties to the efficiency and quality of patient treatment facing the existing state of healthcare administration. There is frequently a lack of smooth information sharing in traditional paper-based and fragmented electronic systems, which causes delays, mistakes, and inefficiencies in patient care.An integrated health care management system is required with light to these obstacles. A system like this would increase data accuracy, automate repetitive jobs, and expedite administrative procedures‚Äîall of which would contribute to better patient care. This project enhances efficiency and accuracy. This technology seeks to revolutionise healthcare administration and improve patient outcomes by facilitating seamless information interchange and offering a unified platform for healthcare workers to view and update patient records.A smart device named "amigo" is developed, which is generally used to detect the illness of the patient and send notifications to the doctor by means of a long beep sound or a red alert. By using this , we can prevent or mitigate the further destruction caused. By this we conclude with the term,

"crave for save" !

This  project basically involves the usage of bluetooth module , wifi module , pulse sensor , SpO2 sensor to detect the illness immediately.We also, have the implementation of DJI inspire_3 which is basically a camera drone that roams around the hospital when the doctor is not under validation . This camera drone searches for the respective doctor and shows him the holographic image to the doctor. With the help of this, the doctor sends his nurses or he himself goes for the rescue. Additionally , we also have max cam_360, which automatically connects the radio waves with the signal waves (selected signal ) when the doctor is no where to be found. Due to this, upto a certain range, all devices under this signal emits a long sound
